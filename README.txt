Field Collection Chart
======================

In early development, basically just use with our current requirements.

Output a field collection as a chart using g.raphael.

Supports the following charts:
- Piechart

Configuration
-------------
1. Add a field collection item and set the display to Piechart.
2. Create the fields which should be data rows in the chart.
   NOTE! The fields have to be number_integer field types.
3. If you want to display descriptions you can add the description in the help
   description of the field widget (ugly I know).
4. Configure the formatter.
